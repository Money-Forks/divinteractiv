My code for Women Who Code's Hackathon for Social Good in June-July 2022. 

## Timeline

* June 15-June 23: Brainstormed and narrowed down ideas. Explored possible tech stacks and decided on a Shiny app because I have some experience coding in R and also wanted to learn how to write code for and deploy web apps. 
* June 25: Completed [this very helpful How To Start Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/). I would definitely recommend watching the video (I did so at 1.5 speed) and also running the code presented in the tutorial that is found in [this Github repo](https://github.com/rstudio-education/shiny.rstudio.com-tutorial).
* June 26: Read more about dividends. 
* June 27: Thought about design of the calculator/interactive part of the web app. 
* June 28: Coded first version of the app, especially the different parts of the navigation bar. I was aided greatly by [this tutorial](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/).
* June 29-July 1: Sick so didn't get any work done on the app but did watch WWC's Mentorship Session on Zoom. 
* July 2: Figured out how to deploy my Shiny app, using information from [shinyapps.io](https://shiny.rstudio.com/deploy/). Also worked on a draft of the project's Hackathon submission statement and presentation.
* July 9-10: Worked on plottign on the "Interactive calculator" page.
* July 16: Completed first draft of the interactive calculator using 5 ETFs.
