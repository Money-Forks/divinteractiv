My code for Women Who Code's Hackathon for social good in July 2022. 

## Timeline

* June 15-June 23: Brainstormed and narrowed down ideas. Explored tech stack and decided on a Shiny app because I have some experience coding in R and also wanted to learn how to code web apps. 
* June 25: Completed [this very helpful How To Start Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/). 10/10 would recommend watching the video (I did so at 1.5 speed) and also running the code presented in the tutorial that is found in [this Github repo](https://github.com/rstudio-education/shiny.rstudio.com-tutorial).
* June 26: Read more about dividends. 
* June 27: Thought about design of the calculator/interactive part of the web app. 
* June 28: Coded first version of the app, especially the different parts of the navigation bar. I was aided greatly by [this tutorial](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/).
